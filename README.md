## 🛠️ Built with C++

### Why C++?
C++ serves as the backbone of **GhostintheshellGPT** to deliver:
- **Unmatched Performance**: Optimized for speed, ensuring efficient handling of computationally heavy AI queries and terminal tasks.
- **System-Level Access**: Fine-grained control over resources, making it ideal for interfacing with models like Llama.cpp.
- **Cross-Platform Scalability**: Built with portability in mind, leveraging modern C++ standards for compatibility on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Rich Libraries**: Utilizes powerful libraries for HTTP handling, file management, and multithreading, ensuring a streamlined and robust development process.

## 🤖 Deep Integration with Llama.cpp

**Llama.cpp**, the lightweight implementation of Meta’s LLaMA models, is the perfect companion to **GhostintheshellGPT**. The program supports **Llama.cpp** natively, allowing you to run **local language models** directly on your machine without the need for cloud APIs.

### How It Works
1. **Dynamic Backend Selection**:
   - Configure the `config.json` file to specify whether to use an external API (e.g., OpenAI) or a local **Llama.cpp** backend.
   - Switch seamlessly between the two modes with no code changes.

   Example configuration snippet:
   ```json
   {
       "backend": "llama.cpp",
       "model_path": "./models/llama-13b.bin",
       "temperature": 0.7,
       "max_tokens": 512
   }
   ```

2. **Llama.cpp Integration**:
   - The program directly interfaces with Llama.cpp's **C++ API**, leveraging shared memory and threads for low-latency inference.
   - Llama.cpp’s highly optimized quantized models ensure excellent performance on standard hardware.

   Example of invoking Llama.cpp:
   ```cpp
   std::string command = "llama.cpp --model " + model_path + " --tokens " + std::to_string(max_tokens);
   std::system(command.c_str());
   ```

3. **On-the-Fly Model Loading**:
   - Dynamically load and unload models based on user queries, enabling flexibility without consuming excessive resources.

4. **Offline Capabilities**:
   - Llama.cpp integration allows users to interact with AI models even without an internet connection, ensuring privacy and accessibility.

## ✨ Features Tailored for Llama.cpp Users

- **Local Inference**: Utilize Meta’s LLaMA models directly from your terminal without relying on external services.
- **Optimized Performance**: C++ ensures efficient use of system resources, even with large-scale models like LLaMA-7B, 13B, or 65B.
- **Custom Prompts**: Create reusable prompt files for common queries, adapting them to specific Llama.cpp model configurations.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Responsive output rendering with color-coded AI responses and progress indicators.

---

## 📂 Example Workflow with Llama.cpp

1. **Configure Your Model**:
   Save your Llama model in the `models/` directory and set the path in `config.json`.

   ```json
   {
       "backend": "llama.cpp",
       "model_path": "./models/llama-13b.bin",
       "temperature": 0.6
   }
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   Launch **GhostintheshellGPT** and interact with your local LLaMA model effortlessly.

   ```bash
   ./ghostintheshellGPT
   ```

3. **Interact with AI**:
   Ask questions or run complex tasks, all powered by Llama.cpp.

   Example terminal output:
   ```plaintext
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Welcome to GhostintheshellGPT!                         │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ 🤖 Model: Llama-13B                                    │
   │ 🔍 Query: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"  │
   │ 💬 Response: "Quantum computing uses qubits, which..." │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```
